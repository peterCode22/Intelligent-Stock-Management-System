#1 index and style files could go to folder Views (just there no subfolder)
#2 Get rid off all the comments and instead make private functions that will say what code is doing and would allow reader to follow the flow of the code.
for example:

// Check if the user is already logged in, if yes then redirect him to welcome page
if(isset($_SESSION["loggedin"]) && $_SESSION["loggedin"] === true)

instead of that check create private method "IsUserLoggedIn" and change the if to

if (IsUserLoggedIn()) and get rid of the comment - if needed pass params to the method.

This example, but its about all the files.

#3 refactor big if with a lot of indentation levels, as for now code in login.php is not really readable.
Starting from
"if($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST"){"
code below could be refactored to smaller pieces methods to make it more readable.
